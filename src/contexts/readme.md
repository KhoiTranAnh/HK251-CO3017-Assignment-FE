# `contexts/` - React Context Providers

If you're using React Context API for global state or shared configurations (like theme, auth status, or language settings), it's a good idea to organize them in their own folder.

Each context file typically includes:

    - The createContext() call
    - A context provider component
    - Any relevant logic or default values
